# Web Developer / Vue.js / Nuxt.js | +4 years experience

My name is Brahim Anjjar. I'm a front-end developer specializing in Vue.js, and Nuxt.js, with over 4 years' experience in creating high-performance, accessible and SEO-friendly websites.

## What I do as a Front-End Developer

I help freelancers, EPPs and project managers design, audit and optimize their websites. My approach combines technical expertise, a focus on performance (Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse), and SEO best practices.

On a daily basis, I develop modern, scalable and responsive interfaces, based on a solid stack: Vue.js, Nuxt.js.

## My career path to become a Front-End Developer

Currently front-end developer at Airlocal Martinique, I'm in charge of :

- Redesign and technical maintenance of Martinique's leading tourism website
- Web performance and SEO optimization
- Continuous improvement of the user experience

Prior to this, I worked freelance on various WordPress projects, where I integrated custom designs, implemented on-page SEO strategies, and improved page load speed.

## My key skills

- Front-end development : Vue.js, Nuxt.js, modern JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Tailwind
- Web performance: Lighthouse audit, Core Web Vitals, image and script optimization
- Technical SEO: sitemaps, tags, accessibility
- Custom WordPress: template integration, theme creation, advanced customization
- Agile methods & tools: Git, GitHub, Bitbucket

## My philosophy

I like to work in a clear, structured and collaborative way. For me, a good website is :

- quick to load
- accessible on all devices
- easy to maintain
- designed for the user and for search engines

I also attach great importance to sharing knowledge, whether as part of a team or through articles.

## What's next?

I'm open to new opportunities, whether freelance, remote or as part of an ambitious tech team.
